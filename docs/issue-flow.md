# Issue Flow

## Creation

- Before creating an issue, check to see if one already exists
- Preferrably you have issue templates setup to guide a user in its creation. One for bugs and one for features. Pleaes refer to the issue templates in this repo.

## Discussion

Try to keep discussion about issues on the issue itself, so that decisions made during conversation do not get lost. Sometimes the results of the discussion can make the original issue irrelevant. In these cases, you can convert the issue to a discussion thread. Once the discussion has settled, you can then create an issue from the finalized comment in the disucssion.

## Labels & Lanes

Labels are often useful to indicate the status of an issue. They may correspond to the [lane or bucket](https://github.com/Exygy/exygy-base/blob/main/docs/agile-processes.md#lanes) of a sprint, or they may be used on PRs to indicate the its status, like work in progress (`wip`) or `ready for review`.

There is not restriction to the number of labels or lanes you use, as they may differ form project to project, but keep it simple and start small. It is much easier to expand than to minimize in this case.
